      <h1>A Brief Bio</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve worked in companies ranging from tiny seed funded startups to the
worlds largest telecoms, ISP&rsquo;s and media companies. I&rsquo;ve been a principal level
technical contributor and have often moved into leadership roles from there
based on organizational need. Several times I have been a direct report
to the C-Suite whether it was the CEO, CTO or COO. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of great
mentors. I try to be a good mentor as often as the opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>I like to think its all had a positive impact.</p>

<p>Heres what some folks have had to say after working with me.
(Last names left off to protect their privacy.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">I have worked with and for Ray over the last 16 years on small 
startup&#39;s and large company&#39;s. Ray&#39;s attention to detail,
commitment his team, hard work, no nonsense attitude, technical 
knowledge and common sense approach are attributes that enable 
him and everyone around him to excel.

Ray has extensive technical and management experience providing 
any company with a switch hitter that can work in the trenches, 
or command at many levels; always leading the way out front 
understanding the job from top to bottom.

Ray and I have worked closely collaborating on many technical 
issues and I&#39;m impressed by his ability to adapt in chaotic 
and stressful situations keeping a even demeanor and attacking 
the problem in a profession a manner. --Mat M.</pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">I have worked with and for Ray on several occasions, these are 
some of my fondest memories. Ray is consummate professional, 
and prides himself in &#34;on time, on spec&#34; work regardless of the 
scale or complexity. 

Extremely knowledgeable, yet very humble, you never get the 
impression that working &#34;for&#34; Ray, rather with him; this also 
provides all that work for him a deep sense of accomplishment, 
as the work seems to fly by, Ray can just make hard work fun, 
this is why Ray has earned a place as one of my &#39;Most trusted 
advisors&#39;. 

I would do anything within reason to work for / with Ray again; 
Ray is the definition of a leader, and is the standard by which 
I measure others. --Chris S.</pre></div>
