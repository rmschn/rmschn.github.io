      <description>For many years I have shared the following Core Values with teams and places I have worked. I figured why not share them here.
Now to be quite honest, I do not recall any longer if I built these on top of something else, or if I just generated these from my own thoughts. So any semblance to others is a happy accident of like mindedness. Over the years, I have modified the wording a bit.</description>

      <description>A blog reboot&amp;hellip; been a lot going on and I figure a reset is in order. I look forward to posting regularly, on what cadence I have not decided yet.
I hope to provide interesting content. This will likely be very tech centric generally. If a post isn&amp;rsquo;t I will tag it in some way
Thanks for coming by!</description>

      <description>Builder. Engineer. Veteran I build systems that last.
Not just because they scale, but because they’re designed with clarity, resilience, and purpose. My work lives at the intersection of deep technical craft and real-world impact—where code meets complexity, and simplicity is hard-won.
For over two decades, I’ve helped large organizations modernize legacy infrastructure, automate fragile processes, and design platforms that empower engineers instead of slowing them down. I’ve led technical transformations in finance, telecommunications, and cybersecurity—turning opaque, high-risk systems into secure, observable, and sustainable ones.</description>
