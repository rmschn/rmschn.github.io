      <description>Trying another hugo static site generation template. Maybe I will actually do some blogging this time around. Who knows.
I never seem to find the time though.</description>

      <description>Professional Bio
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in companies ranging from tiny seed funded startups to the worlds largest telecoms, ISP&amp;rsquo;s and media companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a principal level technical contributor and have often moved into leadership roles from there based on organizational need. Several times I have been a direct report to the C-Suite whether it was the CEO, CTO or COO. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great mentors. I try to be a good mentor as often as the opportunity presents itself.</description>
