      <description>Not a great year in my book. 2019 brought the passing of my father and my only living grandmother. My Dad before his time, and well, my grandmother, she was 96. Wow!
I&amp;rsquo;m ready for a New Year. I&amp;rsquo;m ready for 2019 to be behind me. I&amp;rsquo;m ready for 2020 and to get hammering on all sorts of projects. Rides, Runs, Mountains, Art, Botany, Work. Its the beginning of a new decade of life for me here at the tail end of the year as well.</description>

      <description>Trying another hugo static site generation template. Maybe I will actually do some blogging this time around. Who knows.
I never seem to find the time though.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in companies ranging from tiny seed funded startups to the worlds largest telecoms, ISP&amp;rsquo;s and media companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a principal level technical contributor and have often moved into leadership roles from there based on organizational need. Several times I have been a direct report to the C-Suite whether it was the CEO, CTO or COO. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of great mentors. I try to be a good mentor as often as the opportunity presents itself.</description>
