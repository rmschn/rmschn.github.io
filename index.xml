      <description>A blog reboot&amp;hellip; been a lot going on and I figure a reset is in order. I look forward to posting regularly, on what cadence I have not decided yet.
I hope to provide interesting content. This will likely be very tech centric generally. If a post isn&amp;rsquo;t I will tag it in some way
Thanks for coming by!</description>
