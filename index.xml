      <description>For at least the last 12 years or more, I have shared the following Core Values with teams and places I have worked. Now to be quite honest, I do not recall any longer if I built these on top of something else, or if I just generated these out of thin air from my own thoughts. So any semblance to others is a happy accident of like mindedness. Iâ€™m quite sure over the years, I have modified the wording a bit.</description>

      <description>Working With Me
NOTE: I may update this in the future. Its not a static document.
Inspired by others I have seen over the years, I can&amp;rsquo;t claim complete originality for this document. I have seen others do this and thought it was a good idea. I have been meaning to do it for a while now, and finally got around to it. I hope you find it useful. I know I will.</description>
