Not a great year in my book. 2019 brought the passing of my father and my
only living grandmother. My Dad before his time, and well, my grandmother,
she was 96. Wow! 

I'm ready for a New Year. I'm ready for 2019 to be behind me. I'm ready
for 2020 and to get hammering on all sorts of projects. Rides, Runs, 
Mountains, Art, Botany, Work. Its the beginning of a new decade of life
for me here at the tail end of the year as well. 

2020 is going to see me do a lot of things. I'm not likely to talk much about
them, I'm just going to do them. 

I'm obviously not much of a blogger. Hah.

See ya next year! Hope you have something planned, some goals set and you
hammer for full effect!
