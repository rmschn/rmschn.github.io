      <h1 class="title">Automation</h1>
      <h2 class="date">July 9, 2023</h2>

      
    </header>

    <p>Automation is a very loaded term. First thing to do is define it. Then
work to deliver what is defined. There are requirements that
must be met before you can automate anything. Those requirements are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Case Definitions</li>
<li>Standardization</li>
<li>API availability</li>
<li>CRUD</li>
<li>Least privilege(security)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets dive into each of these defining them and exploring what they really mean.</p>
<p>Lets define automation first.</p>
<p><em><strong>Automation is programmatic process that requires no human hands-on intervention.</strong></em></p>
<p>Now lets cover the things that are necessary in order to implement automation.
Those items mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-definitions">Use Case Definitions</h2>
<p>In order to automate, understanding who the user is, what the user wants to accomplish, where
the user is in relation to the automation, why the automation will be initiated and lastly
the how of it is necessary. Generally the user is quite often another process. That other
process may only require a subset of what the total automation has to offer at any given
invocation.</p>
<p>As a result the use cases should include the the who, what, where, why and how of it all.
Be specific and understand the error conditions of each use case and what should happen as
a result of an error. Beyond that what should happen as a result of success. What is returned?
What is logged? What is stored?</p>
<p>Defining the use cases will help in determining if what is being asked has been standardized
yet. Lets go into that now because honestly, if it hasn&rsquo;t been standardized there is no real
point in attempting to automate yet.</p>
<h2 id="standardization">Standardization</h2>
<p>Automation cannot be applied readily to things that have not been standardized.
Sure, a particular action may be scripted, but that is not really automation is it?</p>
<p>If everything being done is bespoke or unique to itself then it is not a
candidate for automation. Prime targets of automation are things that are
repeatedly done over and over in the same exact fashion with potentially
new arguments being provided. For instance, user account creation. The same
things must happen every time, but the username and some other details may
be provided for each execution may be different. What happens on success is widely understood
as is what should happen given an error occurs.</p>
<p>Generally, once something has been standardized, its requirements, actions and results both
positive and negative are well understood. This usually comes as a result of the activity being
performed over and over again. Once that is happening, the activity gets a standardized
interface. Thats next.</p>
<h2 id="api-availability">API availability</h2>
<p>In order to meet the goal of being programmatic (mentioned in the definition of automation)
the tooling involved must have an available API (Application Programming Interface) that
allows for its use via a program or script. This API likely must at minimum implement
what is commonly know as CRUD, or Create, Read, Update, Delete.
In automating something, an interface is being created for the purpose of performing
an activity repeatedly in the same fashion.</p>
<p>There are lots of choices to be made at this point. For instance, programming language. Will
the interface be RESTful? Will it be delivered via a container? A plugin perhaps? A complete
binary fork of the original tooling with the addition of the new automation API? Those
considerations are beyond the scope of this post. Instead lets focus on CRUD.</p>
<h2 id="crud-create-read-update-delete">CRUD-Create-Read-Update-Delete</h2>
<p>Any API being used to implement automation activities that drive processes
to standardized methodologies needs to implement CRUD. CRUD represents the
lifecycle of any given activity in its most basic form. Each piece of CRUD
can and likely will have variations of actions underneath the covers. There
may even be defaults built in for each activity that may be overridden if
desired. Or it may be beneficial to have no default and force configuration prior to use
of the API implementing CRUD.</p>
<p>Things to consider for each can follow a rather standard set of things. For instance, to
use a CREATE in the API being implemented the interface must understand what is to be created,
how to create it, what success looks like, what failure looks like, what to return to the
user in either case, and what to do with its output entirely. Same sort of thing goes for the
rest.</p>
<h2 id="least-privilege">Least Privilege</h2>
<p>Lastly you want to implement automation using the least amount of privilege necessary
and perform each action with the level of security within the bounds of what is acceptable
risk for the organization and the activity being automated.</p>
<p>This may employ encryption and elevated user privileges among other things. Use an abundance
of caution. Consider how the interface to this automation may be misused if it becomes
available to the wrong party with potentially elevated privileges.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a lot that can be discussed around automation. AI has become a hot topic in
the space. No-Ops, Git-Ops, Chat-Ops, etc.. These are all methods to interact with underlying
automation that needs to have addressed at LEAST the above requirements.
Automation gets delivered in all sorts of ways, RPM, DEB, Docker, Ansible, Shell.
As with anything in tech, what matters is that the requirements are met, and that the
product delivers on those requirements in such a way that it is usable, functional, extensible,
and lastly manageable for its life cycle. Automation is fun! Don&rsquo;t look at it as a
threat, look at it as an opportunity to make our systems earn their keep and free time up to
do more interesting things in the future. Potentially even creating more automation. :)</p>
