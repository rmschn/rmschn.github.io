      <description>For many years I have shared the following Core Values with teams and places I have worked. I figured why not share them here.
Now to be quite honest, I do not recall any longer if I built these on top of something else, or if I just generated these from my own thoughts. So any semblance to others is a happy accident of like mindedness. Over the years, I have modified the wording a bit.</description>

      <description>A blog reboot&amp;hellip; been a lot going on and I figure a reset is in order. I look forward to posting regularly, on what cadence I have not decided yet.
I hope to provide interesting content. This will likely be very tech centric generally. If a post isn&amp;rsquo;t I will tag it in some way
Thanks for coming by!</description>
