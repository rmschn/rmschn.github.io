      <description>For at least the last 12 years or more, I have shared the following Core Values with teams and places I have worked. Now to be quite honest, I do not recall any longer if I built these on top of something else, or if I just generated these out of thin air from my own thoughts. So any semblance to others is a happy accident of like mindedness. Iâ€™m quite sure over the years, I have modified the wording a bit.</description>

      <description>Working With Me
NOTE: I may update this in the future. Its not a static document.
Inspired by others I have seen over the years, I can&amp;rsquo;t claim complete originality for this sort of idea. I most definitely appreciate what it attempts to empower for anyone that is trying to work with the author of such a document.
Anyway, the following is intended to be a guide for working with me.</description>
